        <p>
            Professor Hilton has been talking about how what we are
            learning now is going to be hard at first, but how many of us
            will come to like it more than the languages we have learned
            in the past. I hope to get comfortable with ASP.NET and Visual
            Basic so that I will be more prepared for what is used in the
            industry.

        <h3>Jobs I think would be dope</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some sort of cyber security role (I think doing that for the CIA would be cool)</li>
            <li>Development role - pretty much anywhere</li>
            <li>Analytic role - again anywhere</li>
